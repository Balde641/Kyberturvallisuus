                                    Kyberturvallisuus (Cyber security):
 
 1. Today, the sharp increase in charges between nations is considerable in terms of piracy, espionage and sabotage.
With the rise of technology, this is not a big surprise, as different nations have a notorious reputation for spying on others, vice versa. So today, if organized crime groups are less accused of pirating others, it is probably because they are hired by certain nations to pirate other nations or companies or even individuals.

2. IoT devices connected to the Internet represent the way to a new breach, because if hackers cannot reach their target directly, the use of small IoT devices connected to the Internet step by step will be a very potential option to achieve their goal.
This means that any connected object must be well secured and always updated to be less vulnerable.

3. In theory, an air-gap is physically isolated from the rest of the world, which makes it immune to attacks across the Internet. But that is not 100% safe from hackers, although it is considered by some to be one of the safest ways to protect yourself from hackers.
The science fiction of today is the scientific fact of tomorrow.

4. Even if the dark side of green energy is cybersecurity, it represents a very good alternative against climate change.
The world cannot always stick to the old practice of producing electricity with carbon dioxide while destroying the environment.
It is up to nations to invest more in the safety and security of the electricity/power grid and green energy.

5. Cyber warfare may not be new, but nation states appear to be intensifying their efforts to target the industrial control systems and critical infrastructure of their rivals. These infrastructures range from voting machines to hydraulic and electrical infrastructures.
In this step, it is very important for all the nations of the world to be more aware of this dangerous threat, because if all the important infrastructure of a nation is undermined, it will represent a huge loss, even a collapse of the nation.
